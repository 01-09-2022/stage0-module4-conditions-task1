# Tasks:
#### 1) True printer.
Create a program tha will print "true" to console. Printing command should be placed inside if block
which will have "true" in condition part.  Program should be implemented in code snippet:


        public class ConditionalTruePrinter {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
            }
        }

#### 2) False printer.
Create a program tha will print "false" to console from else part of "if" block. Printing command
should be placed inside else block, whereas "if" condition will have "false" in condition part.  Program should be
implemented in code snippet:


        public class ConditionalFalsePrinter {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
            }
        } 



#### 3) No brackets printer.
Put the brackets to the code snippet so as to not print anything to console in the following
code snippet:


        public class NoBracketsPrinter {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
               if(false) 
                  System.out.println("The statement is true");
               System.out.println("I'm out of checking");
            }
        }


#### 4) Integer comparison.
Fill the gaps in the code snippet so as to program compiles and prints: "Hello world!"


        public class IntegerComparison {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                  int x = 50;
                  int y = 50;
                  __ (x __ y) {
                         System.out.println("Hello World!");
                  }
           }
        }


#### 5) Positive number determainer.
Create a program that will determine and print if consumed number is positive (in this
case print true) or no(print false) using if else block. Program should ne implemented inside of code snippet:


        public class PositiveNumberDetermainer {
           public void isPositive(int numberToBeDetermined) {
           }
        }

Where numberToBeDetermined - var that should be used to print if it is positive.
